                    p One of my favorite projects I've ever built was a data aggregation and display system that collected data generated by 
                        | machines on the plant floor of a manufacturing facility.  It piped the data through in-house servers, then used cloud based 
                        | functions and databases in Azure to move, analyze, and store the data.
                    p It was prototyped on a Raspberry Pi Model B, and ran on Node.js.  Created custom adapters using Modbus for older systems and used
                        | out of the box systems like KEPServerEX to harvest data from devices that were locked up a little tigher from Rockwell and Siemens.

                      | the collected data have been significant part of most of the projects I've worked on.
